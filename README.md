Typescript Playground
=====================

The main purpose of this repo is to have a ready to use repository to try things.
I organized the code in categories under the `src/shared` folder and I implement unit tests for each of them.

## `npm install`

Will install the dependencies

## `npm start`

Will run all the examples

## `npm run dev`

Will run the tests in watch mode.

## Folder structure

The examples are located in [./src/examples](./src/examples). Examples may rely on shared files from [./src/shared](./src/shared)
