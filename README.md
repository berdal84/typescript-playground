Typescript Playground
=====================

A repository to run small piece of code using Typescript language. There is no real objective except maybe to clarify some things I learnt or to learn thinks I do not understand yet.

## `npm install`

Will install the dependencies

## `npm start`

Will run all the examples

## `npm run build`

Will build the examples, only necessary if you fork and want to build without running the examples.

## Folder structure

The examples are located in [./src/examples](./src/examples). Examples may rely on shared files from [./src/shared](./src/shared)
